            <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
            <p>
              By submitting a secret, you represent and warrant that you are 
              old enough to be a consumer. You agree to comply with all
              applicable laws and regulations, including without limitation those

              secret, you understand and accept that such information is not truly
              private. The nature of our platform is inherently social, and as

              You acknowledge that the secrets submitted may be utilized by our
              platform for promotional, advertising, or revenue-generating
              purposes. This may include, but is not limited to, the option for
              other users to purchase access to certain secrets. By submitting a
              secret, you agree that you relinquish any claims to ownership or

                By accepting these Terms, you acknowledge and agree that the 
                platform shall not be held liable for any remorse or regrets 
                associated with the submission of content.
